This file will cover how to use multiple accounts on the same computer. A possibly use case might be you have a personal laptop but 
you are doing work for a client and pushing to a separate repo with a different account (different email).

First, if you haven't already, sign up for Github account, well, TWO in fact. You can do that here: https://github.com/join. I haven't tried it but you might also be able to do this on Bitbucket, for account at Bitbucket, go here: 
Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/

Second, check for your SSH keys. For all things SSH keys related, Github has a great page for [SSH key info](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/).
