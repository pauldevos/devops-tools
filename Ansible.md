# Ansible


### [Ansible Config Variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#ansible-configuration-settings)
- This comes in handy when you're trying to set up or tweet your Ansible configuration.


`ansible-config` utility allows users to see all the configuration settings available, their defaults, how to set them and where their current value comes from. See [ansible-config](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-config.html#ansible-config) for more information.


```bash
ansible-config [view|dump|list] [--help] [options] [ansible.cfg]
```
