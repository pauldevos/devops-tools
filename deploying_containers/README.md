This section will cover how to go about the orchestration, configuration and deployment of containers. 

Technologies I'm most interested in to accomplish this are Terraform, Ansible, Airflow, and obviously, Kubernetes and Docker.

I will look at each of them in a stand-alone sense as well as in a cohesive product. Self healing solutions will also have a heavy focus.




# Kubernetes


Kubernetes
	- Master -- can this be my localhost? Should it?
	- Nodes -- a Kubernetes instance that handles production traffic should have >= 3 nodes.


You can create and manage a Deployment by using the Kubernetes command line interface, __Kubectl__.
